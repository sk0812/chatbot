# Contextual Chatbot

This project is a contextual chatbot that leverages TensorFlow for natural language processing, incorporates text-to-speech capabilities, and utilizes the Llama 3.1 GPT model to handle requests beyond its scope.

## Features

- **Contextual Understanding**: Maintains context in conversations for more relevant and coherent responses.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts text responses into speech for a more interactive user experience.
- **Llama 3.1 GPT Integration**: Utilizes the Llama 3.1 GPT model to handle complex queries and requests that the chatbot cannot manage directly.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for implementation.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the chatbot's natural language processing model.
- **Text-to-Speech**: A library for converting text responses to speech (e.g., `gTTS` or `pyttsx3`).
- **Llama 3.1 GPT**: A language model used for advanced request handling.
